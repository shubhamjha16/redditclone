# College Community Platform: Reddit-Style Forum for Higher Education

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a Reddit-style community platform specifically designed for college communities. The platform will facilitate communication, information sharing, and community building among students, faculty, and staff across multiple colleges and universities, with dedicated spaces for each institution.

## 2. Problem Statement
College students and faculty currently lack a centralized, dedicated social platform that combines the engagement features of Reddit with college-specific functionality. Existing platforms are either too general (like Reddit itself), too formal (like official college portals), or too fragmented (like multiple Discord servers or WhatsApp groups). This creates challenges in building communities around academic interests, sharing course-specific knowledge, organizing campus events, and fostering inter-college networking in an organized manner.

## 3. Objectives
- Create an intuitive, Reddit-style platform tailored to college communities
- Enable different colleges to have their own dedicated spaces while maintaining a unified platform
- Facilitate content sharing and discussions related to courses, academic subjects, campus life, and events
- Foster community building and peer-to-peer support among students
- Provide tools for organizing study groups and academic activities
- Ensure content moderation and community standards appropriate for an educational setting

## 4. Deliverables
- A fully functional web application with mobile-responsive design
- User registration and profile management system with college affiliation
- Subreddit-like spaces for different colleges and topics within colleges
- Content posting, voting, and commenting functionality
- Moderation tools and reporting systems
- Study group organization features
- Event creation and management capabilities
- Search functionality for content, courses, and communities
- User notification system

## 5. Scope
### Included:
- Core Reddit-like functionality (posts, comments, voting, communities)
- College-specific features (course discussions, study groups, events)
- Multi-college support with institution-specific spaces
- Basic moderation and community management tools
- Web platform with mobile responsiveness

### Excluded:
- Mobile native applications (initially)
- Integration with official college systems or LMS platforms
- Advanced analytics and reporting features
- Monetization features
- Direct messaging/chat functionality (initial phase)

## 6. Constraints
- Compliance with educational privacy regulations (FERPA, etc.)
- Limited initial resources for development and maintenance
- Need for careful moderation to maintain academic integrity
- Potential resistance from official college communication channels
- Identity verification challenges for college affiliation
- Scaling requirements as adoption grows across institutions

## 7. Assumptions
- Students and faculty will prefer this platform over existing solutions
- Sufficient interest exists across multiple colleges to create active communities
- Users will contribute content and participate in moderation
- Colleges will not restrict access to the platform
- Basic social media and Reddit-like concepts will transfer well to an academic setting
- The platform can grow organically through word-of-mouth within college communities

## 8. Inputs
- Research on Reddit's architecture and functionality
- User requirements from students and faculty
- Information about college structures and academic organization
- Content moderation best practices for educational settings
- Development resources (framework, hosting, databases)
- UI/UX design principles for community platforms

## 9. Outputs
- A functioning college-oriented community platform
- Active communities organized by colleges and topics
- User-generated content related to academic and campus life
- Documentation for users and moderators
- Analytics on platform usage and engagement
- Framework for expanding to additional colleges and features
